## 💎 Why Fin-Pulse?

Most finance apps fail because they require discipline. You have to remember to log every coffee, every commute, and every transfer. Fin-Pulse changes the game by being **proactive**:

*   **Automation at its Core:** Instead of waiting for you to log an expense, Fin-Pulse "listens" for transactions via notifications and bank SMS. It presents a non-intrusive confirmation bubble immediately after a payment, allowing you to log it in one tap.
*   **Privacy First:** We don't scrape your bank accounts via vulnerable APIs. Everything happens entirely on your device. You have full control over which apps (PhonePe, GPay, Paytm, etc.) Fin-Pulse monitors.
*   **Self-Learning AI:** Cryptic bank messages and merchant UPI IDs are a thing of the past. Fin-Pulse learns to map complex IDs to human-readable names (e.g., it learns that `merchant@vpa` is your "Local Grocery Store").
*   **Luxury Experience:** A premium "Emerald-on-Dark" aesthetic makes managing money feel like a high-end experience rather than a chore.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📱 Smart Transaction Bubble
When a payment is detected, a floating bubble appears over your screen. 
*   **Instant Confirmation:** Verify the amount and merchant in 1 second.
*   **Smart Toggles:** Quickly switch between "Spend" or "Income" if the AI misidentifies the direction.
*   **No Interruption:** Log the expense without leaving the app you are currently using.

### ⚡ Rapid Cash Widget (The 3-Second Rule)
Cash is the hardest thing to track because there's no digital trail. Fin-Pulse solves this with a **Home Screen Widget**.
*   **Instant Mic:** Tap the mic on your home screen to trigger voice recognition.
*   **Voice-to-Data:** Say "Spent 50 on tea" and the AI parses the amount and category instantly.
*   **Log & Forget:** Log cash spends in under 4 seconds before you even put your wallet away. No more "where did my cash go?" at the end of the week.

### 🧪 AI Training Lab
Take control of the automation. Use the Lab to teach the app how to read *your* specific bank's notifications.
*   **Pattern Teaching:** Paste any message to see how it's parsed and correct it to train the model.
*   **UPI Mapping:** Map specific UPI IDs to custom names so they are recognized correctly every time.

### 📊 Insightful Analytics
High-fidelity glassmorphic visualizations show you the pulse of your spending.
*   **Categorized Spending:** See exactly how much you spend on food, travel, shopping, etc.
*   **Transaction Pulse:** A clean, searchable history of every transaction, both digital and cash.

### 🛡️ Monitor Controls
Complete control over your privacy. Choose which apps trigger the tracking bubble. Enable it for your banking apps and GPay, while keeping personal apps like WhatsApp private.
