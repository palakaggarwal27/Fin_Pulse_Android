## 💎 Why Fin-Pulse is Different

Most finance apps fail because they require discipline—you have to remember to log every coffee, every commute, and every transfer. Fin-Pulse flips the script:

*   **Proactive, Not Reactive:** Instead of waiting for you to log an expense, Fin-Pulse "listens" for transactions via notifications and SMS, presenting a 1-tap confirmation bubble immediately after a payment.
*   **Privacy-First Automation:** Unlike apps that scrape your bank accounts via vulnerable APIs, Fin-Pulse works entirely on-device. You choose exactly which apps (PhonePe, GPay, Paytm, etc.) it monitors.
*   **A "Learning" Brain:** It doesn't just use static rules. Through the AI Training Lab, you teach the app how to read *your* specific bank's language. It learns to map cryptic UPI IDs to human names.
*   **Luxury Utility:** Designed with a high-end "Emerald-on-Dark" aesthetic, Fin-Pulse treats your data with the elegance of a luxury watch.

## 🚀 Core Features in Detail

### 📱 Smart Transaction Bubble
The heart of the Fin-Pulse experience. When a transaction is detected from your selected apps, a minimalist floating bubble appears.
*   **Instant Context:** See detected amount and party name at a glance.
*   **Correct & Confirm:** Quickly toggle between "Spend" or "Income" and confirm the category without leaving your current app.
*   **Smart Categorization:** Uses an AI prediction engine to guess the category based on the merchant name or description.

### ⚡ Rapid Cash Widget (Log in 3-4 Seconds)
Digital payments are easy to track, but cash is where most people lose count. Fin-Pulse includes a **Home Screen Widget** specifically for those "on-the-go" moments.
*   **One-Tap Mic:** Tap the mic icon on your home screen to trigger instant voice recognition.
*   **Zero App Opening:** You don't need to find or open the app. A small, elegant dialog appears over your home screen.
*   **Forget-Proof:** By reducing the logging time to just 3-4 seconds (e.g., "Spent 20 on tea"), you log the expense before you even put your wallet back in your pocket.

### 🧪 AI Training Lab (Your Personal Playground)
Take control of the automation. The AI Lab allows you to "stress test" the parser.
*   **Pattern Recognition:** Paste any message to see how the app interprets it.
*   **Correction Logic:** If the AI misses a name or gets the direction wrong, train it instantly.
*   **UPI Mapping:** Directly link specific UPI IDs to custom names so they show up correctly every time.

### 🎙️ Voice-Activated Logging
For cash transactions where there is no notification, simply use the Mic.
*   **Natural Language:** Say "Spent 500 on dinner at Starbucks" and let the AI extract the amount, description, and category.

### 📊 Insightful Analytics
View your lifetime spending patterns through high-fidelity glassmorphic visualizations.
*   **Category Breakdown:** Dynamic pie charts showing where your money is flowing.
*   **Transaction History:** A clean, searchable list of every digital and cash transaction.

### 🛡️ App Monitor Control
Full control over your notification stream.
*   **Selective Listening:** Enable monitoring for PhonePe and GPay while keeping personal messaging apps like WhatsApp private.
